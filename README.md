## Notify

Throughout the day we recieve many different notifications. Whether it's a new text or an e-mail from your boss, they're all important. Sometimes, though, we don't have our phones with us or we can't hear the notification chime. That's where Notify comes in. Notify is an unofficial app that works with your LIFX lightbulb to deliver notification pulses to your light. You can customize the colors that your light will pulse, based on the orgin app of the notification.
